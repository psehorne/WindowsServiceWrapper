MyService.cpp is a wrapper to make a Windows service out of application code.

NOTE: function main() resides in MyService.cpp , not in your app.

ServiceConfig.cpp is an application that is used to cofigure the  Windows service for your app (once your app is ready to be deployed as a Windows service).
